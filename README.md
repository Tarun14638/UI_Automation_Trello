# UI_Automation_Trello
This Selenium-based automation script performs end-to-end actions on Trello to simulate a basic QA workflow. It includes board creation, list and card setup, labeling, attachment handling, card movement, and validation â€” all while ensuring reliability and repeatability.

# Trello UI Automation â€“ Python + Selenium

This script automates the process of logging into Trello, creating a new Scrum board with the current timestamp, adding three default lists (`To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`), creating cards in each list, attaching a PDF to a card, labeling the card, and finally moving the card between lists using the quick card editor.
